# batch2-BLU02 - Timeseries!

## One new dependency

We are making use of one dependency that we had not before called [statsmodel](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html).

If you are on Anaconda, this should already be installed. If you are using pip or the Docker image you'll need to add
it via:

```
pip install --upgrade statsmodels
```

If for some reason, your Anaconda installation doesn't find it, you can open the terminal as described in the Setup repo
and execute the following:

```
conda install statsmodels
```
